# ENCODE AND DECODE WITH VIGENERE CIPHER

this project decodes and encodes a cipher/plaintext with a key in vignere cipher

## Description

The Vigenère cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution. It is a more complex cipher than the Caesar cipher and encrypting a message using the Vigenère cipher is also more secure when compared to that using the Caesar cipher.The Vigenère cipher also gave us perhaps our first glimpse of ‘perfect’ cryptography – that is to say, the information is ‘theoretically secure’.

## the code 
encoding : we can get a random generated key or can provide a key, add in the plain text and let the code convert the text according to the key
decoding : the key and the encoded text must be provided for the code to decode the message

### updates
* to decode a message without using a key
* to check the type of cipher it is
